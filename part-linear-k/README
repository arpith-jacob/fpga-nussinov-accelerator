This is a linear version of the Nussinov array.  Arrays are instantiated along the
'k' dimension.  Points in the i-j plane are computed by its processor in the k
axis.

No partitioning along k is done since this will increase coding complexity.  We
do not anticipate requiring partitioning since we believe we can instantiate this
linear array big enough to process most RNAs.

We decided to partition along the k axis and not on the i or j axis because:
  1. Fewer processing elements are needed: N/2 versus N, although the execution
     time is also higher.
  2. Resource intensive logic for Nussinov + Zuker are concentrated at k=1.  With
     our selected allocation, we are able to contain this logic in one processor.

Given an RNA of length N, the schedule for this array is:

S(i, j, k) = Nj - 2i - k
A(i, j, k) = k

The only constraint is that gcd(2, N) = 1, so N must be odd.  This is already
enforced anyway.
