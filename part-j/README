This is a 2D version of the Nussinov array.  Arrays are instantiated along the
j and k dimensions.  The j axis is tiled, with each processor in the j dimension
executing W_j cells.

Given an RNA of length N, the schedule for this array is:

S(i, j, k) = -W_j i + 2 v_j + 2W_j j' - k
A(i, j, k) = j', k

The only constraint is that gcd(2, W_j) = 1, so W_j must be odd.
The latency of execution is W_j (N-1) + 2N - 2
